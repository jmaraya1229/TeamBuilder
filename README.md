## Installation
To begin, install the application by using `git clone` on this app's [repo](https://github.com/jmaraya1229/TeamBuilder). Then, `npm install` in order to install the required technologies: inquirer and jest. If the install was unsuccessful, the user can install the required techonolgies by typing `npm install inquirer` and `npm install jest` into their terminal. 

## Usage
After installation, the user can begin creating their HTML by starting the application by using `node index.js ` in the terminal. The user will be directed to complete a variable number of prompts depending on how many team members the user wants to add to their team. When the user is finished, they can select `no` to the confirmation message that asks if the user wants to add more team members. 

After completion, the user will be able to access the dynmically generated team builder by opening the `team.html` file that will be located in the Develop folder of the application.
